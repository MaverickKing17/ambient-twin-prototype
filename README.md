**Ambient Twin** is a high-performance, enterprise-grade SaaS designed to modernize the HVAC industry. By creating a "Digital Twin" of residential properties, we connect directly to smart thermostats (Ecobee, Google Nest, Honeywell) to provide real-time telemetry, predictive fault detection, and automated rebate qualifying.
